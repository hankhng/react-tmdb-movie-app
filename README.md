# React Movie TMDB App
Discover the hottest movies and search for your favourite movies. React Movie TMDB App is a movie database and search engine made with ReactJS and powered by [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3). 

## Note

There's an open draft PR where I'm working on implementing functionality for the user to favourite movies and add them to a section. Also dynamic searching using UseEffect, so the search is dynamic as the user types.
